# ball-catching

#### python framework for studying control strategies to Chapman's ball catching problem

This material accompanies my doctoral thesis *On Decomposability in Robot Reinforcement Learning* and the paper *Catching Heuristics Are Robust to Systematic Disturbances  and Can Be Found by Reinforcement Learning*.
&copy; 2017 Sebastian HÃ¶fer

Includes jupyter notebooks providing proofs included in the thesis/paper that were verified with sympy.

### TODO

Code is still missing from the repository; currently only the proofs using sympy are contained.

### Quickstart

- Check out ball-catching from the repository<br/>
```git clone https://gitlab.tubit.tu-berlin.de/shoefer/ball-catching.git```

#### Requirements

- [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter (Notebook)

Follow the installation requirements for these frameworks.

We recommend to use [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which is an easy-to-install complete python bundle that contains all packages required.

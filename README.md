# ball-catching

#### python framework for studying control strategies to Chapman's ball catching problem

This material accompanies my doctoral thesis *On Decomposability in Robot Reinforcement Learning*
&copy; 2017 Sebastian HÃ¶fer

Includes jupyter notebooks providing proofs included in the thesis/paper that were verified with sympy.

### Quickstart

- Check out ball-catching from the repository<br/>
```git clone https://github.com/shoefer/ball_catching.git```

#### Requirements

- [SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter (Notebook)

Follow the installation requirements for these frameworks.

We recommend to use [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which is an easy-to-install complete python bundle that contains all packages required.

## Proofs for Section 4.2: Heuristics for Ball Catching
